# Coffee Shop Landing Page (BEM + Flexbox)

A responsive landing page for a coffee shop, built as part of the TripleTen Full-Stack program.  
The project focuses on clean HTML/CSS architecture using **BEM methodology**, a **flat file structure**, and modern layout techniques.

## Features
- Structured HTML with semantic sections (menu, about, footer)
- Flexbox-based layout for complex sections (menu grid/cards)
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Simple CSS animation in the “About” section (pulsing effect)
- Refactored CSS into a **flat BEM structure** using modular block stylesheets

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (BEM, Flexbox, transitions/animations)
- Git & GitHub

## Project Structure (BEM flat structure)
- `blocks/` — separate stylesheet per BEM block
- `pages/index.css` — contains only `@import` statements
- `vendor/normalize.css` — imported first to ensure consistent base styling
- `images/` — project assets

## What I Practiced
- Applying BEM naming and organizing styles by blocks/elements/modifiers  
- Refactoring a single CSS file into multiple modular block stylesheets  
- Creating consistent layout systems with Flexbox  
- Debugging imports/paths and verifying styles in DevTools  

## Plans for Improvement
- Add mobile-first refinements and improve responsiveness across more breakpoints
- Improve accessibility (contrast, focus states, better semantics)
- Add a light JS enhancement (e.g., smooth scroll navigation or dynamic menu filtering)
