Project 8 continues the Around The U.S. application with a full transition to a scalable, object-oriented, and production-ready architecture.
The project refactors the codebase into multiple ES6 classes, including Section, Card, Popup, PopupWithImage, PopupWithForm, UserInfo, and FormValidator, each responsible for a single, well-defined task. JavaScript destructuring is used to simplify data handling, while loose coupling ensures classes interact only through external handlers defined in index.js. 
The project introduces Webpack for bundling, transpilation, and asset processing, moving all source code into a structured src/ directory and separating build output into dist/. 
This stage emphasizes maintainability, encapsulation, modularity, and professional frontend workflows while preserving full application functionality, validation logic, and user interaction behavior.
