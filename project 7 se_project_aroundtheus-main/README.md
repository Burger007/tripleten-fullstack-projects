In this stage of the Around The U.S. project, I refactored the existing codebase using object-oriented programming and modular JavaScript to improve structure, readability, and maintainability. 
Core functionality was reorganized into reusable classes, including a Card class responsible for rendering and handling card interactions, and a FormValidator class for managing form validation logic. 
The project was restructured to separate components and page logic, with ES module import/export usage enabling clearer responsibility boundaries. This refactor focused on encapsulation, inheritance principles, and clean separation of concerns while preserving all existing functionality.
