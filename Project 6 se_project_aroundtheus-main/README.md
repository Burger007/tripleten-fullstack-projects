In this stage of Around The U.S., I implemented client-side validation for all forms and improved popup usability. 
Validation displays browser error messages under invalid inputs and disables the submit button until all fields are valid, including proper reset behavior when reopening modals.
I also added UX improvements allowing popups to close via overlay click and the Esc key. 
All validation logic was extracted into a dedicated validate.js module and enabled via a reusable configuration object.
